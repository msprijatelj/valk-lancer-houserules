An OVERHEATED mech cannot take any actions or activate abilities that would inflict heat upon themselves, including using OVERCHARGE and activating systems with the HEAT X (SELF) tag. Weapons with the OVERKILL tag instead lose the tag while OVERHEATED. A mech can clear OVERHEATED by taking the STABILIZE action."
