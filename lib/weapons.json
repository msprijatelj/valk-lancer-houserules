    "description": "Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions. There are three lines currently in production.<br>The Type-I (T-1) line is defined by powerful, reliable, and conventional-kinetic ranged and melee weapons, including the GMS assault rifle, heavy machine gun, shotgun, pistol, and various light and heavy blades. Reliable galactic standards, the GMS T-1 line is the most widely used mech-scale line of weaponry across the galaxy. Echoing the Everest’s design notes, T-1 weapons are simply designed, with few (if any) moving parts, intended to be used in or adaptable to any environment.",

Launched from mounted blisters, SWARM/HIVE nanite maniples fall upon their targets as great clouds of teeth, infiltrating sensitive compartments and modules before consuming any organic and inorganic material they touch.",
