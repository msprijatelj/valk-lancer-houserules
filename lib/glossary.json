    "description": "As a quick action, a character may start to handle an adjacent object or willing character by lifting or dragging them. A character may choose to stop handling an object as a free action. Mechs can drag characters or objects up to twice their SIZE but are SLOWED while doing so. They can also lift characters or objects of equal or lesser SIZE overhead but are IMMOBILIZED while doing so. While dragging or lifting, characters can’t take reactions. The same rules apply to pilots and other characters on foot, but they can’t drag or lift anything above SIZE 1/2.<br><br>If a character starts to handle an object handled by a hostile character, the object does not move until it is only handled by characters allied with each other. If a character handling an object is involuntarily moved such that they are no longer adjacent to the object, they cease to handle the object.<br><br>While flying, mechs cannot carry characters or objects with a total SIZE larger than SIZE 1/2 -- there's just not enough thrust. Outside of zero-g environments, when carrying a character or handling an object object while flying, a mech cannot fly higher than 1 space over any surface."

  {
    "name": "!V! Teleport",
    "description": "Characters must start and end a teleport on a surface they can normally move on; for example, a character that can’t fly can’t teleport mid-air. Teleportation ignores obstructions, does not require line of sight, ignores engagement, and does not provoke reactions; however, it still counts as movement and so is affected by conditions like IMMOBILIZED. A teleporting character counts as moving 1 space, no matter how far they travel. If a character teleports, they stop grappling any characters or handling any objects prior to teleporting. Characters can attempt to teleport to spaces they can’t see, but if a space is already occupied, the teleport fails."
