Through a combination of active nanite slurry, hardpatch welding, and shunting to redundant systems in response to immediate damage, they ensure that a chassis will be able to quickly complete nonmassive battlefield repairs in order to remain operational. A number of informal celebratory traditions have arisen throughout the legions to commemorate a pilot's first time taking damage sufficient to trigger an ERM in combat.",
